//! Background HID++ key-capture watcher for a bound keyboard.
//!
//! Runs [`openlogi_hid::run_keyboard_capture_session`] on a dedicated thread
//! for the keyboard the orchestrator publishes in [`SharedKeyboardSpec`],
//! restarts it when the keyboard (or the set of bound keys) changes, and
//! dispatches each captured key press through the common action path
//! ([`crate::runtime::ActionDispatcher`]).
//!
//! The mouse capture watcher ([`super::gesture`]) and this one hold *shared*
//! receiver leases, so both run concurrently; pairing still waits for (and
//! excludes) both. Like the gesture watcher, this needs no macOS Accessibility
//! permission — the key events arrive over HID++.
